Summary of features of v0.02 (2015-05-17)
=========================================

	* Fixed interpretation of return code of "cryptsetup status" which had
	changed with more recent cryptsetup versions to reflect the correct error
	if no such LUKS name was known. Thanks to Eric Murray and Christian
	Pulvermacher for reporting this issue.
	* Forced chunk size to be 10 MiB instead of the default of 3 MiB. Thanks
	to John Morrissey for the bug report (under some weird circumstances, the
	LUKS header apparently can become a lot larger).
	* Fixed a couple of warnings and used stricter compiler flags.
	* Switched to -stc=c11 to be able to use static assertions.
	* Improved error handling for wrong command line parameters (log level
	integer parsing).
	* Improved error handling at cleanup (unsynced luksClose may fail at the
	first try because the device is still busy, sync() filesystems and try up
	to three times now)
	* Display estimated remaining time until finish.
	* Assert resume file can be written to disk by writing it at very start
	once and then seeking to its start.
	* Added README file with detailed instructions.
	* More helpful help page

Summary of features of v0.01 (2011-10-15)
=========================================

	* Ability to convert devices to LUKS format without having to copy the
	contained data over.
