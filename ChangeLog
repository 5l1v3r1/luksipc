Summary of changes of v0.04 (2015-05-28)
========================================
	* Greatly improved handling of disk I/O errors (graceful shutdown in more
	situation instead of simply bailing out)
	* Separated resume file specification and actual request for resuming an
	aborted luksipc process (--resume vs. --resume-file)
	* Unified exit code handling
	* Possibilities to do fault injection in order to efficiently develop and
	test code to increase robustness
	* Included whole test framework in release

Summary of changes of v0.03 (2015-05-25)
========================================
	* Allow reLUKSification of devices (i.e. converting LUKS to LUKS)
	* Checking of mount status of file systems
	* Resume files now have additional sanity checks
	* Fast CRC64-based PRNG generator for filling volumes with check data
	* Major code cleanups and refactoring
	* Major regression testing facilities (auto-aborting and resuming on large
	volumes and on loop devices)
	* Help page of luksipc now looks more professional
	* Partition backup file (128 MiB) is always generated at the start of a
	LUKSification process
	* Option to deactivate safety checks via command line parameter
	(--no-seatbelt)

Summary of changes of v0.02 (2015-05-18)
========================================

	* Fixed interpretation of return code of "cryptsetup status" which had
	changed with more recent cryptsetup versions to reflect the correct error
	if no such LUKS name was known. Thanks to Eric Murray and Christian
	Pulvermacher for reporting this issue.
	* Forced chunk size to be 10 MiB instead of the default of 3 MiB. Thanks
	to John Morrissey for the bug report (under some weird circumstances, the
	LUKS header apparently can become a lot larger).
	* Fixed a couple of warnings and used stricter compiler flags.
	* Switched to -stc=c11 to be able to use static assertions.
	* Improved error handling for wrong command line parameters (log level
	integer parsing).
	* Improved error handling at cleanup (unsynced luksClose may fail at the
	first try because the device is still busy, sync() filesystems and try up
	to three times now)
	* Display estimated remaining time until finish.
	* Assert resume file can be written to disk by writing it at very start
	once and then seeking to its start.
	* Added README file with detailed instructions.
	* More helpful help page

Summary of changes of v0.01 (2011-10-15)
========================================

	* Ability to convert devices to LUKS format without having to copy the
	contained data over.
